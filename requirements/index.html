To view the live video stream, you need:

<ul>
    <li>Cable speed or better download bandwidth (to view high quality live image). Any internal University connection should handle this, as well as most connections provide by high speed internet providers and university campuses.</li>
    <li>A modern web browser with javascript enabled. Internet Explorer 6, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and Safari should handle this.</li>
    <li>(Optional for telepathology) Speaker/phone - to communicate with the pathologist.</li>
